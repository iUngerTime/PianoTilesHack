# Directions
The app is often faster than the animations of the website, feel free to edit the timing.

The game in question uses key presses (not simulated button clicks) to register the presses. The known keys are A S D F presses using directKeys.py

The game screen captures parts of the screen. This was developed on 2 monitor set up, and app initially waits for detction of moving to the second monitor before start. Some modification might be required there.
